# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
# Site-wide settings
# ------------------
#
# title: Your awesome title
#
# author:
#   name: GitHub User
#   email: your-email@domain.com
#
# The `>` after `description:` means to ignore line-breaks until next key. If
#   you wish to omit the line-break after the end of text, use `>-` instead.
# description: >
#   Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this line
#   in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for Google search
#   results) and in your feed.xml site description.


# Build settings
# --------------
#
# If you wish to use the gem-version of Minima with or without a Gemfile, use
#   the following setting:
# theme: minima
#
# **OR** if you wish to use the theme directly from the GitHub repository by
#   bypassing a Gemfile, use the following setting instead.
#   It is best that you lock to a particular commit and update if uptream changes
#   do not affect your site adversely.
# remote_theme: jekyll/minima@d4d779a

# plugins:

#   from newer versions of sass converter. Adapt as required.
